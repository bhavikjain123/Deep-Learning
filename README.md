# Video Classification Model

ðŸŽ¥ðŸ¤– **Advanced video classification model using 3D CNNs and TensorFlow**

This project aims to develop an AI-powered video classification model capable of distinguishing between violent and non-violent content. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the model automates the process of identifying potentially harmful content, contributing to safer online environments and efficient content moderation workflows.

## Methods and Models Used

- **3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Utilized to capture spatio-temporal features from video frames, enabling effective video classification.
  
- **TensorFlow:** Deep learning framework used to build, train, and deploy the video classification model.
## Usage

To use the video classification model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your video dataset:** Ensure your video dataset is in the specified format compatible with the model.
   
2. **Preprocess the videos:** Preprocess the videos by resizing them, normalizing pixel values, and any other necessary steps to prepare them for training.

3. **Train the model:** Utilize the provided scripts to train the video classification model on your prepared dataset. Adjust hyperparameters and configurations as needed.

4. **Evaluate the model performance:** After training, evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

5. **Use the trained model:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it for video classification tasks. Deploy the model in your application or system to classify videos as violent or non-violent.
